# NERF

Nerf is (yet another) rust GUI lib. It is heavily inspired by Flutter, and is designed to build apps that could run on any plateforms, such as windows / linux / macOS, but also web, android...

## Why another GUI lib ?

Nerf started as a hobby side project. It is made to be simple to use, while allowing user to write anything in rust, giving access to it's growing ecosystem.

## Status

This gui lib is still in very early developement, and is not ready for any kind of production use.
